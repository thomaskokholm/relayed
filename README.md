# Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/thomaskokholm/relayed.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push as pull request.
6. Once in master branch, GitHub Pages will rebuild and serve the latests version of the website.
